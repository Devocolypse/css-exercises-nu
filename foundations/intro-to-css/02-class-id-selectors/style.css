/*

As pointed in the solution, one minor optimization here is to create a
separate class just for making the font size 24px and apply to both
the second element and the fourth. In fact, the .large class already
achieves this. This would reduce the repetition (i.e. Don't Repeat
Yourself, or DRY).

However, I do think its super minor, as you have to add .large to two
places anyway, thus making it a similar amount of work to repeating
myself. As a counterpoint to myself, DRYing the code is much more
scalable.
